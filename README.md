This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This will launch the server, worker and the React app.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


# React App: http://localhost:3000
# Server: http://localhost:8080

Each search result is shown as one card to avoid filling up of the viewport prematurely.
